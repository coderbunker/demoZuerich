It is quite simple after you did it once.

1. Open Browser and type "www.qingcloud.com"
2. Login to Qingcloud with your credentials.
3. Choose your Location at the top left corner.
 
4. Go to "Compute & Networking"-> "Instances" and press "new" to create a new instance (incl. the most settings already done)
5. Go to "Compute & Networking"-> "VxNets" and press "create" to create a new private network. 
6. Choose your new private network and associate it to your instance.
7. Go to "Compute & Networking"-> "Elastic IPs" and press "apply" to create a new IP-range for your instance.
8. Choose your new IP-range and associate it to your instance.
